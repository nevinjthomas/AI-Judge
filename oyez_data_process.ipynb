While the Navajo Treaty signed between the Navajo nation and the United States did not explicitly exempt the nation from state laws, Arizona entered the Union on the explicit condition that it would lose its authority over Indian tribes and reservations within the state, including taxation powers.

       "32  <p>No. In a unanimous decision, the Court reversed the decision of the Arizona Court of Appeals and held that Arizona did not have the right to tax McClanahan. In an opinion authored by Justice Thurgood Marshall, the Court emphasized the long-standing status of Indian reservations as exempt from state authority. While the Navajo Treaty signed between the Navajo nation and the United States did not explicitly exempt the nation from state laws, Arizona entered the Union on the explicit condition that it would lose its authority over Indian tribes and reservations within the state, including taxation powers. Consistent with its decision in <em>Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona State Tax Commission</em>, the Court ruled that Arizona \"had no jurisdiction to impose\" state income tax on McLanahan.</p>\\n   \n",

       "32  Rosalind McClanahan was a member of the Navajo Indian nation who lived on the Navajo Reservation in Apache County, Arizona. Her employer withheld $16.20 in 1967 for Arizona state income taxes. McClanahan sought the return of her withheld income. She claimed that since she was a Navajo Indian residing on the reservation and since her income was derived completely on the reservation, she was exempt from state taxation. When her request was denied, she filed suit in Apache County Superior Court. The Superior Court dismissed her claim. The Court of Appeals of Arizona affirmed the dismissal. The Supreme Court of Arizona rejected her petition for review.  "

       "      <td>Yes. Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., delivered the opinion for the 8-1 majority. The Court held that a search or seizure is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when an officer has made a reasonable factual or legal mistake. Because Fourth Amendment jurisprudence turns on the question of reasonableness, governing officials have traditionally been allowed leeway to enforce the law for the community's protection. As long as the mistake of fact or law in question was reasonable, the Fourth Amendment does not hold such mistakes to be incompatible with the concept of reasonable suspicion. However, the Court also held that those mistakes must be objectively reasonable; an officer cannot gain the benefits of Fourth Amendment reasonableness through a sloppy or incomplete knowledge of the law. In her concurring opinion, Justice Elena Kagan emphasized that the majority opinion's analysis was limited to when the mistake of law in question is an objectively reasonable one. Justice Kagan also wrote that the test to determine whether an officer made an objectively reasonable mistake is much more stringent than the one to determine whether a government official is entitled to qualified immunity. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined in the concurring opinion. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion in which she argued that Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has traditionally focused on the officer's factual conclusions rather than understanding of the law. Expanding leeway allowed to police officers with respect to their factual assessment to the meaning of the laws they are meant to enforce runs the risk of eroding the Fourth Amendment's protections. In the absence of any evidence that holding police officers to this standard would prevent effective enforcement of the law, mistakes of law should not be considered reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</td>\n",

       "      <td>['On April 29, 2010, Sergeant [UNK] of the [UNK] County Sheriff\\'s Department observed [UNK] Javier [UNK] driving north on I - 77 with a broken brake light. When [UNK] pulled over the vehicle, he noticed another man, Nicholas [UNK], lying under a blanket in his backseat. [UNK] spoke with the two men, felt that their stories did not match up, and was concerned that [UNK] has not gotten up from the back seat. [UNK] asked for permission to search a vehicle. [UNK] agreed, and [UNK] found a bag containing 2. 2 pounds of cocaine in the car. A grand jury indicted [UNK] for two counts of trafficking cocaine. [UNK] filed another lawsuit to suppress the evidence discovered during the search of his vehicle, but the trial court denied the motion. The North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed the trial court that held that the traffic stop was not objectively reasonable because North Carolina law only required one working brake light. The North Carolina Supreme Court reversed and held that when an officer\\'s mistake of the law is reasonable, it may give rise to the \" reasonable suspicion \" required for a traffic stop of a vehicle under the Fourth Amendment. That North Carolina Supreme Court sent the case back to the state Court of Appeals. The North Carolina Court of Appeals found no error in the trial court\\'s judgment. A dissenting judge, however, stated that the North Carolina Supreme Court\\'s ruling created \" fundamental unfairness \" because it held citizens to the traditional rule that \" ignorance of the law is no excuse \" while allowing police to be ignorant of the law. Based on this dissent, [UNK] again appealed to the North Carolina Supreme Court which rejected [UNK]\\'s motion.']</td>\n",

       "2503  ['On April 29, 2010, Sergeant [UNK] of the [UNK] County Sheriff\\'s Department observed [UNK] Javier [UNK] driving north on I - 77 with a broken brake light. When [UNK] pulled over the vehicle, he noticed another man, Nicholas [UNK], lying under a blanket in his backseat. [UNK] spoke with the two men, felt that their stories did not match up, and was concerned that [UNK] has not gotten up from the back seat. [UNK] asked for permission to search a vehicle. [UNK] agreed, and [UNK] found a bag containing 2. 2 pounds of cocaine in the car. A grand jury indicted [UNK] for two counts of trafficking cocaine. [UNK] filed another lawsuit to suppress the evidence discovered during the search of his vehicle, but the trial court denied the motion. The North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed the trial court that held that the traffic stop was not objectively reasonable because North Carolina law only required one working brake light. The North Carolina Supreme Court reversed and held that when an officer\\'s mistake of the law is reasonable, it may give rise to the \" reasonable suspicion \" required for a traffic stop of a vehicle under the Fourth Amendment. That North Carolina Supreme Court sent the case back to the state Court of Appeals. The North Carolina Court of Appeals found no error in the trial court\\'s judgment. A dissenting judge, however, stated that the North Carolina Supreme Court\\'s ruling created \" fundamental unfairness \" because it held citizens to the traditional rule that \" ignorance of the law is no excuse \" while allowing police to be ignorant of the law. Based on this dissent, [UNK] again appealed to the North Carolina Supreme Court which rejected [UNK]\\'s motion.']  "
