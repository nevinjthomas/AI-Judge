Bartlett subsequently sued the officers for damages under 42 YOU.S.C. § 1983, making claims including false arrest and imprisonment, excessive force, malicious prosecution, and retaliatory arrest. The district court granted summary judgment to the officers on all claims. The YOU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s ruling on the retaliatory arrest claim, explaining that under its own precedent, a showing of probable because did not preclude a claim of retaliatory arrest. The appellate court noted that in 2012, the YOU.S. Supreme Court had clarified that its decision in Hartman v. Moore, 547 YOU.S. 250 (2006), which held that a plaintiff could not make a retaliatory prosecution claim if the charges were supported by probable because, did not necessarily extend to retaliatory arrests.

       "      <td>The presence of probable because for an arrest defeats a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim as a matter of law. Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the majority opinion. To prevail on a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim, the plaintiff must show that the official acted with a retaliatory motive and that the motive was the “but-for” because of the plaintiff’s injury. The Court looked to analogous situations to determine how to identify whether improper motive caused the injury: the torts of false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Analysis of motive of these torts supports the conclusion that the presence of probable because should defeat a retaliatory arrest claim, regardless of the subjective motive of the arresting officer. Thus, if the officer has probable because, then even the presence of a retaliatory motive motive is irrelevant unless the plaintiff presents “objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been” (an equal protection, rather than First Amendment, argument). Justice Clarence Thomas joined the majority opinion as to all but Part II-D (in which the Court described a narrow qualification for the situation in which officers have probable because for an arrest but exercise discretion not to do so). He wrote separately to concur in part and concur in the judgment. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion.</td>\n",

But a concurring opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell and joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Harry A. Blackmun would not go so far as to hold sex discrimination to the same standard as race, choosing instead to argue that statutes drawing lines between the sexes alone necessarily involved the \"very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Constitution,\" an approach employed in the Court's prior decision in Reed v.

After the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized doctor-prescribed marijuana from a patient's home, a group of medical marijuana users sued the DEA and YOU.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft in federal district court. The medical marijuana users argued the Controlled Substances Act - which Congress passed using its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce - exceeded Congress' commerce clause power. The district court ruled against the group. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and ruled the CSA unconstitutional as it applied to intrastate (within a state) medical marijuana use. Relying on two YOU.S. Supreme Court decisions that narrowed Congress' commerce clause power - YOU.S. v. Lopez (1995) and YOU.S. v. Morrison (2000) - the Ninth Circuit ruled using medical marijuana did not \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce and therefore could not be regulated by Congress.</td>\n",

The majority argued that Congress could ban local marijuana use because it was part of such a \"class of activities\": the national marijuana market. Local use affected supply and demand in the national marijuana market, making the regulation of intrastate use \"essential\" to regulating the drug's national market. The majority distinguished the case from Lopez and Morrison. In those cases, statutes regulated non-economic activity and fell entirely outside Congress' commerce power; in this case, the Court was asked to strike down a particular application of a valid statutory scheme.</td>\n",

Rhode Island’s statute was passed in 1969 and provided state financial support for non-public elementary schools in the form of supplementing 15% of teachers’ annual salaries. The appellants in the Pennsylvania case represented citizens and taxpayers in Pennsylvania who believed that the statute violated the separation of church and state described in the First Amendment. Appellant Lemon also had a child in Pennsylvania public school. The district court granted the state officials’ motion to dismiss the case. In the Rhode Island case, the appellees were citizens and tax payers of Rhode Island who sued to have the statute in question declared unconstitutional by arguing that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

       "      <td>Do statutes that provide state funding for non-public, non-secular schools violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?</td>\n",
       "      <td>Yes. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion for the 8-0 majority as to the Pennsylvania statute and 8-1 as to the Rhode Island statute. The Court held that a statute must pass a three-pronged test in order to avoid violating the Establishment Clause. The statute must have a secular legislative purpose, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither promotes nor inhibits religion, and it must not foster “excessive government entanglement with religion.” The Court held that both the state statutes in question had secular legislative purposes because they reflected the desire of the states to ensure minimum secular education requirements were being met in the non-public schools. The Court did not reach a holding regarding the second prong of the test, but it did find that the statutes constituted an excessive government entanglement with religion. In the Rhode Island program, the amount of oversight of teachers and curricula required to ensure that there is no unnecessary injection of religion into secular topics would require the government to become excessively involved in the nuances of religious education. The same danger holds true for the Pennsylvania statute, which additionally provides state funding directly to a church-related organization. Government financial involvement in such institutions inevitably leads to “an intimate and continuing relationship” between church and state. The Court also noted the potential political implications of public funding, as there is a risk of religious issues becoming politically divisive. In his concurring opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the intrusion of the government into the running of non-public schools through grants and other funding creates the entanglement that the Establishment Clause prohibits. He also argued that non-secular schools are so thoroughly governed by religious ideologies that any amount of public funding supports those doctrines, which the Framers of the Constitution dictated the government must not do. Justice Hugo L. Black joined in the concurrence, and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the parts relating to case numbers 569 and 570. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a separate concurrence in which he argued that the danger was not only that religion would infiltrate the government, but also that the government would push secularization onto religious creeds. An analysis of the statutes in question shows that they impermissible involve the government in “essentially religious activities,” which the Establishment Clause is meant to prevent. In his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Byron R. White wrote that the majority opinion goes too far and, in restricting the use of state funds in non-secular schools, creates an obstacle to the use of public funds for secular education. He argued that there was no proof that religion would invade secular education or that the government oversight of the use of public funds would be so extensive as to constitute entanglement. Justice Thurgood Marshall did not participate in the discussion or decision of case number 89.</td>\n",

       "      <td>African-American applicants for firefighter jobs in Chicago, IL sued the city under Title VII alleging the written test used for hiring had a disparate impact. After administering the test, the city graded the scores and placed applicants in three categories: \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" and \"not qualified.\" Because the city had only 600 positions to fill among 1,782 \"well qualified\" applicants, \"qualified\" applicants were unlikely to get job offers. The class of plaintiffs in this suit allege that the test disparately categorized them as \"qualified.\" An Illinois federal district court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit held that the plaintiffs' suit was untimely and dismissed. The court stated that the 300 day limit for filing such a claim began when the plaintiffs learned that they had been placed in the \"qualified\" category and that the city would be hiring those in the \"well qualified\" category. The court reasoned that because there was no fresh act of discrimination, the time for filing a Title VII claim began when the discriminatory decision was made and not when it was executed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Supreme Court held that a plaintiff may file his Title VII disparate impact claim within 300 days after the employer executes the allegedly unlawful practice so long so as he alleges each of the elements of a disparate impact claim. Justice Antonin G. Scalia, writing for a unanimous Court, reasoned that the principle inquiry in this case is not when the firefighters' claims accrued, but whether the claims stated a Title VII violation. The Court concluded that the firefighters successfully stated a Title VII violation within the claim-filing period when they alleged that the city caused a disparate impact on African-Americans each time it used its hiring list.</td>\n",

(Integrity), a company that provides warehouse space and staffing to clients such as Amazon.com. Busk and Laurie both worked in warehouses in Nevada filling orders placed by Amazon.com customers. At the end of each day, all the workers were required to pass through a security clearance checkpoint where they had to remove their keys, wallets, and belts, pass through a metal detector, and submit to being searched. The whole process could take up to 25 minutes. Similarly, up to ten minutes of the workers' 30-minute lunch period was consumed by security clearance and transition time. In 2010, Busk and Castro sued Integrity and argued that these practices violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) as well as Nevada state labor laws. The district court granted Integrity's motion to dismiss and held that time spent clearing security was non-compensable under the FLSA and that the shortened meal periods were not relevant to the FLSA because the plaintiffs did not argue that they performed work-related duties during their lunch periods. The YOU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. While the Court of Appeals agreed that the shortened lunch periods were not relevant to the FLSA, the Court of Appeals held that the district court should have assessed the plaintiffs claims that the security clearances were \"integral and indispensable\" to their work in order to determine if that time was compensable.</td>\n",

       "      <td>No. Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court, which held that the time spent by warehouse workers undergoing security screenings is not compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act. The Portal-to Portal Act exempted employers from liability for claims dealing with activities that are preliminary or postliminary to the principle activities that an employee is employed to perform. The screenings in this case are not a principle activity and were not integral to the employees' duties; therefore the screenings are not compensable. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a concurring opinion in which she stated that the screenings are not integral or indispensable activities because the employee could dispense with them without impairing his ability to perform the principle activity safely and effectively. Justice Elena Kagan joined the concurring opinion.</td>\n",

(DIRECTV), and argued that DIRECTV had improperly charged early termination fees to its customers. In 2011, the YOU.S. Supreme Court decided AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, in which the Court held that the Federal Arbitration Act preempted California precedent that had previously held that, in certain circumstances, arbitration clauses in customer agreements were unenforceable. Less than one month after that decision, DIRECTV moved to stay or dismiss the plaintiffs’ case and compel arbitration, which DIRECTV argued it had not done previously because it thought the arbitration clause in its customer agreement was void under California precedent. The trial court denied the motion and the California Court of Appeal for the Second District affirmed by holding that the language of the customer agreement subjected the arbitration clause to state law.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Did the California Court of Appeal err in holding that a reference to state law in an arbitration clause required the application of that state law despite its preemption by the Federal Arbitration Act?</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Federal Arbitration Act preempts state law, so the court has to enforce the arbitration agreement. Justice Stephen G. Breyer delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that requiring contract enforcement under California state law that the Supreme Court had held was invalid under AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion would conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act. Absent any indication that the language of the contract is meant to refer to invalid state law, it should be construed as only referring to valid state law, which is consistent with California state law. The Court also noted that there was no indication that a California court would apply state law that has been held to be invalid because it conflicts with federal law to any other context. Even in the canon of cases that determine that ambiguous language in a contract should be construed against the party that drafted the language, there is no case that goes so far as to apply invalid state law. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent in which he argued that the Federal Arbitration Act did not apply to state courts and therefore did not require the court to order arbitration in this case. In her separate dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that the provision should be construed against the drafting party so as to give the consumer the ability to pursue class-based litigation. Because the relevant question should be whether both parties agreed to be bound by relevant state law as framed by the state legislature without considering the preemptive effect of federal law, the California state court’s decision should control this case. Although the Federal Arbitration Act contains a presumption in favor of arbitration, the presumption only applies when the express agreement to arbitrate was validly formed, which is not the case when consumers lack bargaining power in the creation of such contracts. Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined in the dissent.</td>\n",

       "      <td>William Fiore and his co-defendant, David Scarpone, were convicted of operating a hazardous waste facility without a permit in violation of Pennsylvania State law after deliberately altering a monitoring pipe. Fiore appealed his conviction to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, which affirmed the conviction. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court then denied further review of Fiore's case, and his conviction became final. Scarpone appealed his conviction to the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, which noted the existence of a \"valid permit\" and set aside the conviction. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed and found that Scarpone's conduct did not constitute the operation of the facility without a permit because the law Fiore and Scarpone were convicted under does not apply to those who possess a permit but deviate radically from the permit's terms. Fiore had asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review his case after it had agreed to review Scarpone's case and twice more after it decided Scarpone. The court denied Fiore's requests. Fiore sought federal habeas relief, arguing that the YOU.S. Constitution required that his conviction be set aside because his conduct was not criminal under the statutory section charged. The District Court granted his petition. .The YOU.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed on the ground that it would require a retroactive application of a new rule of law. Following oral argument, a unanimous court in an opinion by Justice Stephen J. Breyer  certified the question whether the court's interpretation of the statute set forth in Scarpone's case stated the correct interpretation of Pennsylvania law on the date when Fiore's conviction became final. The Court also reserved judgment and further proceedings in the case pending a response by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Justice Breyer wrote for the Court that \"the answer to this question will help determine the proper state-law predicate for our determination of the federal constitutional questions raised in this case.\" The Pennsylvania Supreme Court replied that the decision \"did not announce a new rule of law,\" but \"merely clarified the plain language of the statute.\" The YOU.S. Supreme Court then took up the pending constitutional question.</td>\n",

Since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision was not a new rule, it governed Fiore's case even though the case was final before the decision was handed down. The Court found that since Fiore had a permit, his offense was not covered by the statute he was convicted under.

Bartlett subsequently sued the officers for damages under 42 YOU.S.C. § 1983, making claims including false arrest and imprisonment, excessive force, malicious prosecution, and retaliatory arrest. The district court granted summary judgment to the officers on all claims. The YOU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s ruling on the retaliatory arrest claim, explaining that under its own precedent, a showing of probable because did not preclude a claim of retaliatory arrest. The appellate court noted that in 2012, the YOU.S. Supreme Court had clarified that its decision in Hartman v. Moore, 547 YOU.S. 250 (2006), which held that a plaintiff could not make a retaliatory prosecution claim if the charges were supported by probable because, did not necessarily extend to retaliatory arrests. And since that time, the Ninth Circuit had held that a plaintiff could make a retaliatory arrest claim even if the arresting officers had probable because.    \n",

Federal law provided that the wives of members of the military automatically became dependents; husbands of female members of the military, however, were not accepted as dependents unless they were dependent on their wives for over one-half of their support. Frontiero's request for dependent status for her husband was turned down.    \n",

Other FRA rules allowed railroads to administer breath and urine tests to employees who violate certain safety rules.    \n",

California's law conflicted with the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which banned possession of marijuana. After the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized doctor-prescribed marijuana from a patient's home, a group of medical marijuana users sued the DEA and YOU.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft in federal district court. The medical marijuana users argued the Controlled Substances Act - which Congress passed using its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce - exceeded Congress' commerce clause power. The district court ruled against the group. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and ruled the CSA unconstitutional as it applied to intrastate (within a state) medical marijuana use. Relying on two YOU.S. Supreme Court decisions that narrowed Congress' commerce clause power - YOU.S. v. Lopez (1995) and YOU.S. v. Morrison (2000) - the Ninth Circuit ruled using medical marijuana did not \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce and therefore could not be regulated by Congress.    \n",

The Pennsylvania statute was passed in 1968 and provided funding for non-public elementary and secondary school teachers’ salaries, textbooks, and instructional materials for secular subjects. Rhode Island’s statute was passed in 1969 and provided state financial support for non-public elementary schools in the form of supplementing 15% of teachers’ annual salaries. The appellants in the Pennsylvania case represented citizens and taxpayers in Pennsylvania who believed that the statute violated the separation of church and state described in the First Amendment. Appellant Lemon also had a child in Pennsylvania public school. The district court granted the state officials’ motion to dismiss the case. In the Rhode Island case, the appellees were citizens and tax payers of Rhode Island who sued to have the statute in question declared unconstitutional by arguing that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The district court found in favor of the appellees and held that the statute violated the First Amendment.    \n",

After administering the test, the city graded the scores and placed applicants in three categories: \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" and \"not qualified.\" Because the city had only 600 positions to fill among 1,782 \"well qualified\" applicants, \"qualified\" applicants were unlikely to get job offers. The class of plaintiffs in this suit allege that the test disparately categorized them as \"qualified.\" An Illinois federal district court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit held that the plaintiffs' suit was untimely and dismissed. The court stated that the 300 day limit for filing such a claim began when the plaintiffs learned that they had been placed in the \"qualified\" category and that the city would be hiring those in the \"well qualified\" category. The court reasoned that because there was no fresh act of discrimination, the time for filing a Title VII claim began when the discriminatory decision was made and not when it was executed.    \n",

(Integrity), a company that provides warehouse space and staffing to clients such as Amazon.com. Busk and Laurie both worked in warehouses in Nevada filling orders placed by Amazon.com customers. At the end of each day, all the workers were required to pass through a security clearance checkpoint where they had to remove their keys, wallets, and belts, pass through a metal detector, and submit to being searched. The whole process could take up to 25 minutes. Similarly, up to ten minutes of the workers' 30-minute lunch period was consumed by security clearance and transition time. In 2010, Busk and Castro sued Integrity and argued that these practices violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) as well as Nevada state labor laws. The district court granted Integrity's motion to dismiss and held that time spent clearing security was non-compensable under the FLSA and that the shortened meal periods were not relevant to the FLSA because the plaintiffs did not argue that they performed work-related duties during their lunch periods. The YOU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. While the Court of Appeals agreed that the shortened lunch periods were not relevant to the FLSA, the Court of Appeals held that the district court should have assessed the plaintiffs claims that the security clearances were \"integral and indispensable\" to their work in order to determine if that time was compensable.    \n",

(DIRECTV), and argued that DIRECTV had improperly charged early termination fees to its customers. In 2011, the YOU.S. Supreme Court decided AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, in which the Court held that the Federal Arbitration Act preempted California precedent that had previously held that, in certain circumstances, arbitration clauses in customer agreements were unenforceable. Less than one month after that decision, DIRECTV moved to stay or dismiss the plaintiffs’ case and compel arbitration, which DIRECTV argued it had not done previously because it thought the arbitration clause in its customer agreement was void under California precedent. The trial court denied the motion and the California Court of Appeal for the Second District affirmed by holding that the language of the customer agreement subjected the arbitration clause to state law.    \n",
       "792   William Fiore and his co-defendant, David Scarpone, were convicted of operating a hazardous waste facility without a permit in violation of Pennsylvania State law after deliberately altering a monitoring pipe. Fiore appealed his conviction to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, which affirmed the conviction. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court then denied further review of Fiore's case, and his conviction became final. Scarpone appealed his conviction to the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, which noted the existence of a \"valid permit\" and set aside the conviction. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed and found that Scarpone's conduct did not constitute the operation of the facility without a permit because the law Fiore and Scarpone were convicted under does not apply to those who possess a permit but deviate radically from the permit's terms. Fiore had asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review his case after it had agreed to review Scarpone's case and twice more after it decided Scarpone. The court denied Fiore's requests. Fiore sought federal habeas relief, arguing that the YOU.S. Constitution required that his conviction be set aside because his conduct was not criminal under the statutory section charged. The District Court granted his petition. .The YOU.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed on the ground that it would require a retroactive application of a new rule of law. Following oral argument, a unanimous court in an opinion by Justice Stephen J. Breyer  certified the question whether the court's interpretation of the statute set forth in Scarpone's case stated the correct interpretation of Pennsylvania law on the date when Fiore's conviction became final. The Court also reserved judgment and further proceedings in the case pending a response by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Justice Breyer wrote for the Court that \"the answer to this question will help determine the proper state-law predicate for our determination of the federal constitutional questions raised in this case.\" The Pennsylvania Supreme Court replied that the decision \"did not announce a new rule of law,\" but \"merely clarified the plain language of the statute.\" The YOU.S. Supreme Court then took up the pending constitutional question.    \n",

Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the majority opinion. To prevail on a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim, the plaintiff must show that the official acted with a retaliatory motive and that the motive was the “but-for” because of the plaintiff’s injury. The Court looked to analogous situations to determine how to identify whether improper motive caused the injury: the torts of false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Analysis of motive of these torts supports the conclusion that the presence of probable because should defeat a retaliatory arrest claim, regardless of the subjective motive of the arresting officer. Thus, if the officer has probable because, then even the presence of a retaliatory motive motive is irrelevant unless the plaintiff presents “objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been” (an equal protection, rather than First Amendment, argument). Justice Clarence Thomas joined the majority opinion as to all but Part II-D (in which the Court described a narrow qualification for the situation in which officers have probable because for an arrest but exercise discretion not to do so). He wrote separately to concur in part and concur in the judgment. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion.    \n",

The Court held that the statute in question clearly commanded \"dissimilar treatment for men and women who are similarly situated,\" violating the Due Process Clause and the equal protection requirements that clause implied. A majority could not agree on the standard of review, however. The plurality opinion written by Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., applying a strict standard of review to the sex-based classification as it would to racial classification, found that the government's interest in administrative convenience could not justify discriminatory practices. But a concurring opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell and joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Harry A. Blackmun would not go so far as to hold sex discrimination to the same standard as race, choosing instead to argue that statutes drawing lines between the sexes alone necessarily involved the \"very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Constitution,\" an approach employed in the Court's prior decision in Reed v. Reed. Justice Potter Stewart concurred separately that the statutes created invidious discrimination in violation of the Constitution. Justice William H.

Stevens argued that the Court's precedent \"firmly established\" Congress' commerce clause power to regulate purely local activities that are part of a \"class of activities\" with a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The majority argued that Congress could ban local marijuana use because it was part of such a \"class of activities\": the national marijuana market. Local use affected supply and demand in the national marijuana market, making the regulation of intrastate use \"essential\" to regulating the drug's national market. The majority distinguished the case from Lopez and Morrison. In those cases, statutes regulated non-economic activity and fell entirely outside Congress' commerce power; in this case, the Court was asked to strike down a particular application of a valid statutory scheme.    \n",
       "1894  Yes. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion for the 8-0 majority as to the Pennsylvania statute and 8-1 as to the Rhode Island statute. The Court held that a statute must pass a three-pronged test in order to avoid violating the Establishment Clause. The statute must have a secular legislative purpose, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither promotes nor inhibits religion, and it must not foster “excessive government entanglement with religion.” The Court held that both the state statutes in question had secular legislative purposes because they reflected the desire of the states to ensure minimum secular education requirements were being met in the non-public schools. The Court did not reach a holding regarding the second prong of the test, but it did find that the statutes constituted an excessive government entanglement with religion. In the Rhode Island program, the amount of oversight of teachers and curricula required to ensure that there is no unnecessary injection of religion into secular topics would require the government to become excessively involved in the nuances of religious education. The same danger holds true for the Pennsylvania statute, which additionally provides state funding directly to a church-related organization. Government financial involvement in such institutions inevitably leads to “an intimate and continuing relationship” between church and state. The Court also noted the potential political implications of public funding, as there is a risk of religious issues becoming politically divisive. In his concurring opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the intrusion of the government into the running of non-public schools through grants and other funding creates the entanglement that the Establishment Clause prohibits. He also argued that non-secular schools are so thoroughly governed by religious ideologies that any amount of public funding supports those doctrines, which the Framers of the Constitution dictated the government must not do. Justice Hugo L. Black joined in the concurrence, and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the parts relating to case numbers 569 and 570. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a separate concurrence in which he argued that the danger was not only that religion would infiltrate the government, but also that the government would push secularization onto religious creeds. An analysis of the statutes in question shows that they impermissible involve the government in “essentially religious activities,” which the Establishment Clause is meant to prevent. In his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Byron R. White wrote that the majority opinion goes too far and, in restricting the use of state funds in non-secular schools, creates an obstacle to the use of public funds for secular education. He argued that there was no proof that religion would invade secular education or that the government oversight of the use of public funds would be so extensive as to constitute entanglement. Justice Thurgood Marshall did not participate in the discussion or decision of case number 89.    \n",

Justice Antonin G. Scalia, writing for a unanimous Court, reasoned that the principle inquiry in this case is not when the firefighters' claims accrued, but whether the claims stated a Title VII violation. The Court concluded that the firefighters successfully stated a Title VII violation within the claim-filing period when they alleged that the city caused a disparate impact on African-Americans each time it used its hiring list.    \n",

The Portal-to Portal Act exempted employers from liability for claims dealing with activities that are preliminary or postliminary to the principle activities that an employee is employed to perform. The screenings in this case are not a principle activity and were not integral to the employees' duties; therefore the screenings are not compensable. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a concurring opinion in which she stated that the screenings are not integral or indispensable activities because the employee could dispense with them without impairing his ability to perform the principle activity safely and effectively. Justice Elena Kagan joined the concurring opinion.    \n",

Justice Stephen G. Breyer delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that requiring contract enforcement under California state law that the Supreme Court had held was invalid under AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion would conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act. Absent any indication that the language of the contract is meant to refer to invalid state law, it should be construed as only referring to valid state law, which is consistent with California state law. The Court also noted that there was no indication that a California court would apply state law that has been held to be invalid because it conflicts with federal law to any other context. Even in the canon of cases that determine that ambiguous language in a contract should be construed against the party that drafted the language, there is no case that goes so far as to apply invalid state law. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent in which he argued that the Federal Arbitration Act did not apply to state courts and therefore did not require the court to order arbitration in this case. In her separate dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that the provision should be construed against the drafting party so as to give the consumer the ability to pursue class-based litigation. Because the relevant question should be whether both parties agreed to be bound by relevant state law as framed by the state legislature without considering the preemptive effect of federal law, the California state court’s decision should control this case. Although the Federal Arbitration Act contains a presumption in favor of arbitration, the presumption only applies when the express agreement to arbitrate was validly formed, which is not the case when consumers lack bargaining power in the creation of such contracts. Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined in the dissent.    \n",

Since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision was not a new rule, it governed Fiore's case even though the case was final before the decision was handed down. The Court found that since Fiore had a permit, his offense was not covered by the statute he was convicted under. The Court concluded that \"Fiore's conviction fails to satisfy the Federal Constitution's demands.\"    \n",
